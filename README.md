# BlackJackpython
I just made this blackjack game on python and thought I would upload on here.
There are two versions of the game.
The first version is more a basic one, but with better visuals for the users, whereas the second one is a more advanced but lesser visuals for the user.
Thank you, hope you enjoy it.
